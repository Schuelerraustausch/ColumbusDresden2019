After lunch we got a really exiting task - to build an enclosure around a cooked
egg, so that it can survive a drop out of the third floor.

The students worked in small groups and mostly used balloons, a plastic bag and
the eggs packaging.

After that they dropped their eggs altogether out of an window in the third floor
of the BSZET.

Most of the eggs survived the fall with out any harm. In the end only one groups
egg got damaged by the impact.

There were some really creative projects, like that one with a crumple zone and
a parachute. Another group even decided to wrap their eggs completely with
balloons.
