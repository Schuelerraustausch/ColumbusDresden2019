In the evening a small group of the students went out, to explore the city one
last time together. The first stop was Barneby, a place we had been already a
few days before. It is a bar in the Dresden Neustadt, where you can play a bunch
of board games.

Some of the games were really difficult to play with the American students
because of the language barrier, but most of the games are also known in
the USA, although sometimes under different names.

Later we visited the GrooveStation in the Neustadt, danced a little bit and
then played some billiard.
