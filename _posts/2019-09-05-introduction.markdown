For the program, 10 students and 6 teacher traveled from Columbus in Ohio to
Dresden in Germany. They arrived at Thursday, the 5th of September 2019.

At Thursday afternoon, the American students first meet their German
counterparts.

In the next ten days, they will stay together in the
[A&O Hostel in Dresden](https://www.aohostels.com/en/dresden/) in groups of two
students - a German and an American one.

They first met each other in the auditorium of the
[BSZET Dresden](https://www.bszet.de/) - the school of the German students.

While the German students all came from different parts of the educational
system - mostly high school and educational training, the US students all came
from the [Columbus State Community College](https://www.cscc.edu/).

There was a lot to talk and get to know each other. Of course food and drinks
were also provided with coffee and cake.
