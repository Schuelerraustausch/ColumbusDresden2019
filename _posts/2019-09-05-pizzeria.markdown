## Pizzeria

In the evening, the group had lunch at the pizzeria
[L'Osteria at the Prager Stra√üe in Dresden](https://losteria.net/de/restaurants/restaurant/dresden-prager-carree/).

This place was nice for the first lunch, since it is near the hostel and
centered in the city - therefore a good place to start some expeditions into the
city after the meal.

Everybody had fun there and we talked with our new room mates for the week. The
meal was nice and the pizzas were really big.

The mood was really nice, everybody was happy and so exited to experience the
new culture.

After the lunch, the teachers continued the introduction into the program and
set the times, where everybody had to be back at the hostel.

In the evening the students explored the city and checked out the bars in the
Dresdener Neustadt.
