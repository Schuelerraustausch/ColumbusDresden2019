At first we had a guided tour through the city hall. A niece lady showed us some
of the buildings room and told us a little bit about the history of the city
hall.  
One hall in the building still had all the ballots from the vote count after the
recent state election in Saxony.  
Of course, all of the students dressed nice for that occasion. Some even wore
full suits.
The last stop before visiting the mayor was one of the bigger halls for a group
picture.

Finally we met Mr. Hilbert. Together with Paul Carringer and  Mr. Peschke, the
principal of the BSZET he gave a short speech to our group.

The mayor talked - of course in english - about the relationship of the two
partner cities and the reasons for funding the student exchange program.

There was also a short speech given by two of the US students as representatives
of the city of Columbus ans especially the Columbus State Community College and
in the end they handed over the key to the city of Columbus to Mr. Hilbert.
