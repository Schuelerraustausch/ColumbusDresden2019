Before noon all the students signed on each others t-shirts or immortalized
themselves in some other way, for example with a nice picture, a nice quote or
the words "Sauerkraut" and "Bratwurst".

The presentation was finished with a nice picture of the group and of course
everybody had to wear their decorated t-shirt.
