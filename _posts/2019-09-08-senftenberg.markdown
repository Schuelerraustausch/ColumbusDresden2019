There were no big plans for sunday - it was a free day. So a group of the
students decided to drive a bit around and vistit the Lake Senftenberg.

The first stop on the tour was a lookout tower for tourists - the so called
rusty nail.

The next stop was the Lake Geierswald. There we rented a boot and made a trip
to the Lake Senftenberg. Driving the boot and swimming in the lake was a lot of
fun.
