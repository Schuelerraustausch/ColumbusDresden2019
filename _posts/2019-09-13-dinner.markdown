On Friday night we had our last dinner together with the whole group, including
the American and German teachers.

The [March√©](https://www.marche-movenpick.de/de/unsere-standorte/dresden)
in the main station was chosen as location. This restaurant offers a buffet
with a wide variety of food and drinks. It is located in a hall alongside the
foyer of the main station, has the buffet and some tables in the ground floor
and additional tables for larger groups in the first floor with plenty of space,
a nice view onto the buffet from above and good lighting from the glass roof.

After dinner, a speech was held on the success of the student exchange by the
teachers and everybody congratulated and thanked them for the successful
organization of the project.

Finally we took a picture of the two American students, two German teachers and
two German students who already met each other in the autumn of the last year,
when they participated in the student exchange from Dresden to Columbus, Ohio.
