Barbecue - the Germans really love it. And it is not jsut about eating, but also
a social gathering.

Since you have to wait some time, before the food on the grill is ready, you
can do some sports to pass time. For example playing frisbee. Or you can play
with the american football. But that is not so easy. It took quite some time for
the American students to teach the German student how to throw a football
properly. But in the end they managed to do that fine.

German sausages - as the American students said, they were a bit bigger and more
flavourful than in the US, but not that different.

And if all food is consumed, the social gathering begins. The people sit around
the fire, talk and warm themselfes around the fire ...
