In the evening of our second full day in Germany, we took a little tour to
the Dresdener Neustadt as usually.

We visited a bar and played a few games there - mostly Jenga. Its the perfect
game for diverse groups, because the rules are easy and the rounds end really
fast.

After that we headed to a second bar and talked a bit about our hobbies and
mutual interests.

Finally we ended the day at the roof of the hostel.
